%# function [smdata] = smooth(data,window)						
%#											
%# AIM:	Performs average smoothing on spectral data.				
%#											
%# PRINCIPLE: The function smoothes the original data by calculating a moving		
%#		      average on a finite-size spectral window. On both ends of the spectrum, 
%#		      points outside the spectral window are determined by second-order	
%#		      polynomial extrapolation before calculating the average.

%# INPUT: data (m x n): Original data set (each row is a spectrum)		
%#		  window: Spectral window size, must be an odd number (default: 3)	默认为3（必须是奇数）
%#											
%# OUTPUT: smdata (m x n): Smoothed data set.
