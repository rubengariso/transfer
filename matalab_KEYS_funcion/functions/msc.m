%#  AIM: 	Multiple Scatter Correction:				
%#		To remove the effect of physical light scatter 		
%#		from the spectrum. (Compensation for particle size	
%#		effects.)						
%#								
%#  PRINCIPLE:  Each spectrum is shifted and rotated so that it fits 	
%#              as closely as possible to the mean spectrum of the data.
%#		The fit is achieved by LS (first-degree polynomial).	
%#		The correction depends on the mean spectrum of the 	
%#		training set.						
%# 									
%#  INPUT:	x: (m x n) matrix with m spectra and n variables	
%#		first: first variable used for correction		
%#		last: last variable used for correction			
%#		 (A segment is selected which is representative for the	
%#		 baseline of the spectra.)				
%#		xt: (mt x nt) matrix for new data (optional)		
%#			 						
%#  OUTPUT:	xmsc: (m x n) matrix containing the spectra after	
%#		    	  correction with msc				
%#		me: mean spectrum (1 x n) of x				
%#		xtmsc: (mt x nt) matrix containing the new spectra after
%#			  correction with msc
